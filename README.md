In this exercize I used PostgreSQL to complete a research project on employees using what remained of the data from a fictional corporation in the 1980s and 1990s: six CSV files.

Data provided. Code original.

## Full Assignment Description:

<b>Data Modeling</b>
  <i>
   - Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 
   - Create an image file of your ERD.
  </i>
  
<b>Data Engineering</b>
<i>
  - Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
  - Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
</i>

<b>Data Analysis</b>
<i>
Once you have a complete database, do the following:

  - List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
  - List employees who were hired in 1986.
  - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
  - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
</i>

<b>Bonus</b>
<i>
 - Import the SQL database into Pandas
 - Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employee
 - Create a bar chart of average salary by title
